# S2 / S3 Emission Contract v1.0

Extends to Phases 2 and 3 the fixed-heading discipline Phase 1 already mandates
("the structure below is downstream-facing and Phase 3 depends on it — do not
alter the headings"). Phase 2 currently has no filename convention; Phase 3
explicitly disclaims a fixed shape. Both emit the documents Phase 4 must parse.

**Adoption rule.** Headings and column headers are fixed. Rows are not. A
document that renames a heading, drops a column, or omits an ID is
non-conforming, and `emission-check` fails the build before K7 is spawned.

## 1. Identifier scheme

Every run-level entity carries an ID. Format: `^[A-Z]+-[0-9]{2,}$`.

| Prefix | Entity | Minted in |
|---|---|---|
| `OBJ-nn` | object / class node | Phase 2 |
| `MOD-nn` | module | Phase 3 §2 |
| `SEAM-nn` | seam contract | Phase 3 §4 |
| `REF-nn` | refusal test | Phase 3 §5 |
| `VEC-nn` | golden vector | Phase 3 §6 |
| `HOOK-nn` | hook specification | Phase 3 §7 |
| `PC-nn` | production concern | Phase 3 §8 |
| `AE-nn` | admitted exception | Phase 2 |
| `GX-n` / `GBC-n` | axiom / base case | Phase 1 (existing convention) |

**Rules.** IDs are assigned at first emission, never reused, never renumbered.
A superseded entity keeps its ID and takes status `SUPERSEDED`; a new ID carries
the replacement. Cross-references use the ID, never the prose name.

Rationale: the framework asserts "every S2 node maps to exactly one Phase 3
destination" and "every S3 element maps to exactly one Phase 4 destination."
Neither is checkable without a key.

## 2. Status vocabularies

Exactly two enums. The corpus currently uses five spellings for one concept.

**Entity status** — `PROPOSED` · `ACTIVE` · `DEFERRED` · `DISCHARGED` · `SUPERSEDED` · `REFUSED`

**Module readiness** — `NOT_STARTED` · `BUILT` · `COMPLETE` · `BLOCKED`

`BUILT` means code exists and its suite is green. `COMPLETE` additionally means
CT-1..CT-6 all discharged. The distinction RD-16 calls
"BUILT-but-NOT-COMPLETE" is these two values, not a third spelling.

## 3. Phase 2 document — `CLAUDE_<Concept>_Phase2.md`

Filename is now fixed. Headings, in order, verbatim:

```
## 1. Concept and S1 provenance
## 2. Expressed Object Model
## 3. Admitted family
## 4. Refused edges and abstractions
## 5. Admitted exceptions
## 6. Carried judgment for Phase 3
## 7. Open questions
```

**§2 Expressed Object Model** — the definitive object set. One row per node.

| ID | Node | Kind | Tag | Traces to | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`Traces to` cites a Phase 1 element (`GX-n`, `GBC-n`, or a Traceability Map row).

**§4 Refused edges and abstractions**

| ID | Refused item | Kind | Reason | Preserved as |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**§5 Admitted exceptions**

| ID | Exception | Scope | Justification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

---

## 4. Phase 3 document — `CLAUDE_<Concept>_Phase3.md`

Sections are **numbered**, in order, verbatim. Numbering is load-bearing:
`completion-ledger.md` cites "S3 §11", which currently resolves to nothing.
Under this contract §11 is the module completion checklist and the citation
becomes true without editing the ledger.

```
## 1. Disambiguation header
## 2. Resolved partition
## 3. Object-to-module map
## 4. Seam contracts
## 5. Refusal tests (CT-4)
## 6. Golden vectors (CT-5)
## 7. Hook manifest (CT-6)
## 8. Production concerns
## 9. Open decision gates
## 10. Build order
## 11. Module completion checklist
```

**§2 Resolved partition**

| ID | Module | File | Owns OBJ | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**§3 Object-to-module map** — the join CC-1 and traceability completeness read.
Every `OBJ-nn` from Phase 2 §2 appears exactly once.

| OBJ | MOD | Role |
|---|---|---|

**§4 Seam contracts**

| ID | Source MOD | Target MOD | Transferred value | Dependency requirement | Validation rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**§5 Refusal tests (CT-4)** — `Test name` is the field that makes CC-4 and CC-6
mechanical. Without it no S3 refusal row can be joined to an executable case.

| ID | MOD | Invariant | Forbidden input | Expected rejection | Test name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**§6 Golden vectors (CT-5)** — `Rule` must be stated independently of the
vector; a value whose rule is recoverable only from the vector fails CT-5.
`Encoding` names the serialization of Input and Output, without which
`--rederive` cannot compare.

| ID | MOD | Pinned value | Rule | Input | Output | Encoding | State | Discharge condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`State` is `COMPUTED` or `DEFERRED`. A `DEFERRED` row with an empty
`Discharge condition` is an omission, not a deferral, and fails emission-check.

**§7 Hook manifest (CT-6)** — each row also emits the Appendix A grammar, which
already exists in the Phase 1 roster and is currently never carried into Phase 3.

| ID | MOD | Trigger | Condition | Block action | Registered at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

```
HOOK <id> @<trigger> { condition: <condition>, BLOCK: <action> }
```

**§8 Production concerns** — mints the `PC-*` IDs Phase 5's W-DISCHARGE already
joins on. Phase 5 consumes "every PC-* from the S3"; nothing currently creates them.

| ID | MOD | Concern | Class | Owner | Discharge target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**§11 Module completion checklist**

| MOD | CT-1 | CT-2 | CT-3 | CT-4 | CT-5 | CT-6 | PC enum | Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

---

## 5. Vector persistence and the `--rederive` interface

`--rederive` appears exactly once in the plugin (`k7-reviewer.md:51`) and is
nowhere defined. CC-5 cannot be mechanical until it is.

**Storage.** One file per vector: `vectors/<VEC-ID>.json`

```json
{
  "id": "VEC-01",
  "module": "MOD-03",
  "rule": "<the rule, stated independently of this vector>",
  "encoding": "utf8-json",
  "input": "<encoded>",
  "output": "<encoded>",
  "state": "COMPUTED",
  "computed_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "impl_sha": "<sha256 of the implementation file at computation time>"
}
```

**Interface.** `rederive <VEC-ID>` or `rederive --all`.
Recomputes `output` from `input` by invoking the implementation, compares under
`encoding`, and exits `0` on match, `1` on mismatch, `2` on a vector that cannot
be located or whose module is unbuilt. `--all` fails if any vector fails.
`DEFERRED` vectors are skipped and reported, never counted as passes.

`impl_sha` is what proves the vector was computed rather than hand-written: a
vector whose `impl_sha` predates the implementation file's first commit is a
CC-5 failure.

## 6. Dangling references this closes

| Defect | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `completion-ledger.md` cites "S3 §11"; no S3 numbering exists | §4 above numbers the S3; §11 is the checklist |
| Phase 5 joins on `PC-*`; Phase 3 never mints them | §8 assigns `PC-nn` |
| CC-5 calls `--rederive`; undefined | §5 specifies it |
| CC-4/CC-6 need "named tests"; no naming convention | §5 `Test name` column |
| `Status` has five spellings | §2 two enums |
| Appendix A `HOOK` grammar unused downstream | §7 carries it into the S3 |

## 7. What becomes mechanically checkable

Once emitted under this contract, each of these is a script, not a judgment:

- **CC-1** — `MOD` set in §2 versus the source tree, via the `File` column.
- **Traceability completeness** — every `OBJ` in Phase 2 §2 appears exactly once
  in S3 §3; every `MOD` in §2 is the source or target of at least one `SEAM`.
- **Deferred/discharged join** — every `VEC` with `State: DEFERRED` has a
  discharge condition and a matching completion-ledger row.
- **Vector re-derivation** — `rederive --all`.
- **Refusal coverage** — every `REF` row's `Test name` resolves to a real test,
  and deleting the guarded call makes exactly that test fail.
- **Hook manifest** — every `HOOK` id in §7 is registered at its `Registered at`
  path in the built repo.

What remains for K7 is the residue: whether the implementation is faithful to
intent in ways no column can capture. That residue is small enough to be
answered the same way twice.
